# Introduction to Kindmetrics

Kindmetrics is website analytics that is open source and focuses on privacy for both the visitors and you.

The mission of Kindmetrics is to provide useful analytics that is easy to use and have anything you need without giving away your information to big corporations for surveillance.

Kindmetrics started as an idea 2019 and got build 2020 by inspiration of other privacy analytics companies by Håkan Nylén.

Kindmetrics is trying to take another step towards privacy and are using as much as possible EU-based services. Other privacy companies that might be EU-based are using US-based providers. This means the data is still being sent through a US-based company. We are honest to say that we are using one US provider, Digitalocean, but are continually looking for alternatives in the EU.

Our software is open-source and free to use for everyone, but for those who don't want to set everything up can use our managed service. It is not free but is used to pay for the hosting and my time so that I can build better analytics for you.
