# Self-hosting

We have added a beta version of self-hosting. It is not something we have time to support but let those who know how to setup servers can do themselves if they want.

## Why self-hosting?

We think that those who really think about privacy won't pay for hosted Kindmetrics, they want to really own their own data.

So we let them use Kindmetrics and help contribute with feedback and maybe code changes.

## How to start?
full documentation (that is up to date) can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/kindmetrics/kindmetrics).

You would need to add yourself as a admin to bypass the limitatino of plans in self-hosting. check [the add admin page](/self_hosting/add_admin.html).
