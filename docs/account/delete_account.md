# Delete your account

You can always delete your account (and all your data) whenever you want. You can do that easily through your account settings.

# How to delete your account
You login and click on your name on the top-right corner and click on settings.

Click then on `Delete your account` - Confirm you really want to delete it together with all data connected to your account and you should now be deleted and be logged out. Depending on how much data you have it can take some time for it to log you out.
