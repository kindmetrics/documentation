# Delete your account

You can always delete your account (and all your data) whenever you want. You can do that easily through your account settings.

# How to delete your account
You log in and click on `User Settings` in the bottom-left corner.

Click then on `Delete your account` - Confirm you want to delete it together with all data connected to your account, and you should now be deleted and be logged out. Depending on how much data you have, it can take some time to log you out.
